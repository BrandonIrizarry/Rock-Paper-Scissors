* Instructions

** Basic Player Instructions
Enter ~rock~, ~paper~ or ~scissors~, depending on the play you want to
make. Substrings of these words are acceptable as respective
replacements; for example, you can simply enter ~ro~, or even ~r~, for
rock.

** Quitting the Game
Entering one of ~quit~, ~q~, or ~exit~ as a game input at any point
will exit the game, and display a farewell message, as well as either
not entering anything and hitting OK, or else simply cancelling the
user prompt.

** Winners
At the end of the five rounds, the scores are displayed, and a winner
is declared in the obvious manner (higher number of points wins, or
else a tie is declared).
