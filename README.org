* Rock Paper Scissors
** Introduction
  This is a simple Web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock
  Paper Scissors". 

  The game starts out with both players (you and the computer)
  at 0. The game is ready to play as soon as the page is loaded.

** Rounds
  Select any of the three possible plays at the bottom (click or tap,
  depending on your device.)

  When you select a play, the computer makes a play: if your play
  wins, your score is incremented. If the computer's play wins, its
  score is incremented. If a tie, neither score is incremented.

  A winning play is accompanied by a brief yellow flash on the side of
  the player who won that round. A tie causes both sides to flash
  blue.

** Objective
  The first player to reach five points wins the game. You are offered
  a choice to play the game again.
