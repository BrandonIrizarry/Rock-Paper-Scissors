* Improve design with an eye towards mobile use [1/5]

This is still a rough draft. Ideas:

1. [X] Include suggestive images or icons (SVG, Unicode) for "rock",
   "paper", and "scissors".

2. [ ] Fix button-click bug: clicking on either the image or the
   button should trigger the event.

3. [ ] Change '#player' and '#computer' background colors depending on
   who won the round (the current approach assigns fixed background
   colors to these players.)

4. [ ] When the game is over, dynamically introduce a button into the
   DOM that offers to restart the game.

5. [ ] Generally improve the UI look of the information layout in the
   '#computer' and '#player' divs.

6. [ ] Make the title at least a little more prominent, if not
   somewhat nicer.
