* Improve design with an eye towards mobile use [1/5]

This is still a rough draft. Ideas:

1. [X] Include suggestive images or icons (SVG, Unicode) for "rock",
"paper", and "scissors".

2. [ ] Change '#player' and '#computer' background colors depending on who won
the round (the current approach assigns fixed background colors to
these players.)

3. [ ] When the game is over, dynamically introduce a button into the DOM
that offers to restart the game.

4. [ ] Generally improve the UI look of the information layout in the
'#computer' and '#player' divs.

5. [ ] Make the title at least a little more prominent, if not somewhat
nicer.
